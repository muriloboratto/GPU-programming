What is the PML layer in MPI?

What is this flags compilations: ^vader, tcp, openib, smcuda?


NCCL
------

I would like a simple code in C++ on GPUs using the commands ncclSend and ncclRecv for the API NCCL NVIDIA


Can you create a simple code in C++ on GPUs using the commands ncclBcast for the API NCCL NVIDIA?


RTM

Create a complete simple code example in C using a seismic imaging method called Reverse time migration (RTM), using as finite difference methods for wave propagation, and that you have seismic data and velocity model.
