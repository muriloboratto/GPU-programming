    "It is necessary to carry out communication operations involving multiple computational resources in most parallel applications. These communication operations can be implemented through point-to-point operations. However, this approach could be more efficient for the programmer. Parallel and distributed solutions based on collective operations have long been chosen for these applications. The MPI pattern has very efficient routines that perform collective operations, taking better advantage of the computing power of the available computational resources. Likewise, with the advent of new computational resources, similar routines appear for multi-GPU systems, for example,  [NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/index.html). This notebook will cover handling these routines for multi-GPU environments, constantly comparing them with the MPI standard and showing the differences and similarities between the two computational execution environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main characteristics of using these types of operations is that communications can have different symmetries and asynchronous, considering factors such as emission and reception. For collective operations, symmetry is defined as the characteristic that all involved resources have to perform the same functions with similar parameters. Asynchronous is defined as the inherent characteristic that all the detailed resources have of not waiting for the others to finish to continue the execution. Considering that collective operations are communication patterns that affect all computational resources of an execution group, it was possible to compare aspects of collective operations using multiprocessor and multi-GPU systems, described below."

All resources must invoke both in the __comm__ communicator group. Parts send the information stored in __buff__ of the __root__ resource to everyone else belonging to the execution group. The parameters __count__ and __datatype__ have the functions of specifying the amount of memory that the resource __root__ should send to others and the space they should reserve to store the received message.

    "A `Gather` operation is a collective operation where a computational resource scans information from a set of resources. From one point of view, the `Gather` operation is the inverse of the `Scatter` operation. The difference for this last one resides in a combination of data from a receiving resource, which is solely stored. The syntax of the `Gather` function for GPUs corresponds to the __ncclAllGather__ command, which is related to the concept of `AllGather`, which is a routine invocation equivalent to performing *n* calls to the operation, which each time acts as __root__."
