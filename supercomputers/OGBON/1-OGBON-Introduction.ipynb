    "Welcome to the webinar _GPU Programming Concepts_. In this webinar you will learn several techniques for scaling single GPU applications to multi-GPU and multiple nodes, with an emphasis on [NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/index.html), [CUDA-aware MPI](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-cuda-aware-mpi/), and [NVSHMEM](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvshmem) which allows for elegant multi-GPU application code and has been proven to scale very well on systems with many GPUs."
