CUDA-aware MPI is an MPI implementation that allows GPU buffers (e.g., GPU memory allocated with cudaMalloc) to be used directly in MPI calls. However, CUDA-aware MPI alone does not specify whether data is stored in intermediate stages in CPU memory or passed from GPU to GPU. It will depend on the computational structure of the execution environment.\n",

    "The GPUDirect is an umbrella name used to refer to several specific technologies. In MPI, the GPUDirect technologies cover all kinds of inter-rank communication: intra-node, inter-node, and RDMA inter-node communication. Now let us take a look at the code below. It is the same as the tested version of MPI+CUDA, but now there are no calls to cudaMemcpy during the ping-pong steps. Instead, we use our GPU buffers (__d_A__) directly in MPI calls:"
